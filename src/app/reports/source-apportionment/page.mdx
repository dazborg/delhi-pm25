# Source Apportionment of PM2.5 in Delhi: A Systematic Review

## Abstract

Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Delhi routinely exceeds World Health Organization guidelines by a factor of ten or more, making the identification of contributing sources a critical prerequisite for effective air-quality management. This review systematically synthesises findings from six major source apportionment studies and institutional reports conducted between 2013 and 2018, encompassing receptor modelling (chemical mass balance and positive matrix factorisation), dispersion modelling, and emission-inventory approaches. Across the reviewed literature, vehicular emissions (16--39%), biomass and crop-residue burning (14--30%), road and construction dust (13--21%), industrial activity (6--35%), secondary inorganic aerosols (21--30%), and waste burning (8--10%) emerge as the principal source categories, though their relative contributions vary substantially by method, season, and geographical boundary. The pronounced methodological heterogeneity precluded formal meta-analysis; a narrative synthesis was therefore adopted. Representative consensus estimates are proposed for policy use, and key research gaps -- including the scarcity of post-2020 studies and poor quantification of transboundary transport -- are identified.

## 1. Introduction

Delhi's air-quality crisis is among the most severe in the world. Annual-mean PM2.5 concentrations at regulatory monitors have consistently exceeded 100 &mu;g/m&sup3; over the past decade, roughly seven times the WHO annual guideline of 15 &mu;g/m&sup3; (revised 2021) and well above India's own National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 40 &mu;g/m&sup3;. The health burden is substantial: the Global Burden of Disease Study attributes hundreds of thousands of premature deaths annually in India to ambient particulate pollution, with the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) contributing disproportionately to this toll.

Effective mitigation requires more than knowledge of aggregate pollution levels. Policymakers need to understand which sources contribute what fraction of PM2.5 mass so that interventions can be prioritised, costed, and sequenced. Source apportionment -- the quantitative attribution of ambient pollutant concentrations to their emission origins -- provides this evidence base. Without it, regulatory effort risks being misdirected: targeting a source that contributes five per cent of the problem while neglecting one that contributes thirty per cent would be both inefficient and inequitable.

Over the past decade, several major studies have attempted to apportion Delhi's PM2.5. These span a range of analytical techniques, sampling periods, and geographical boundaries, and their findings are not always consistent. The purpose of this review is to bring these disparate results together in a systematic and transparent manner, to identify areas of consensus and disagreement, and to derive representative source-contribution estimates suitable for informing policy analysis.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Search Strategy

A structured literature search was conducted across four electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The search combined terms related to the pollutant ("PM2.5" OR "fine particulate matter"), the location ("Delhi" OR "National Capital Region" OR "NCR"), and the analytical approach ("source apportionment" OR "receptor model" OR "emission inventory" OR "chemical mass balance" OR "positive matrix factorisation"). The search covered publications from January 2010 to December 2023. No language restrictions were imposed, although all retrieved studies were published in English. Reference lists of included studies and relevant review articles were hand-searched to identify additional records. Major institutional reports from government-commissioned studies were included where they provided primary data not available in the peer-reviewed literature.

### 2.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Studies were included if they (a) focused on ambient PM2.5 in Delhi or the wider NCR, (b) employed a recognised source apportionment methodology (receptor modelling, dispersion modelling, or hybrid approaches), and (c) were published in peer-reviewed journals or as major institutional reports with sufficient methodological detail for quality assessment. Studies were excluded if they addressed only PM10 without separate PM2.5 analysis, if the study area did not include any part of Delhi, or if the publication was a conference abstract without full supporting data. Where multiple publications reported on the same dataset, the most comprehensive version was retained.

### 2.3 Quality Assessment

Given the absence of a standardised quality-assessment tool for environmental source apportionment studies, an adapted framework drawing on criteria from the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies and the principles outlined by Belis et al. (2014) for receptor-modelling evaluation was used. Studies were assessed on five domains: (i) representativeness of sampling sites, (ii) adequacy of sampling duration and temporal coverage, (iii) completeness of chemical speciation, (iv) transparency and appropriateness of the modelling approach, and (v) treatment of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. Each domain was scored as adequate, partially adequate, or inadequate. No study was excluded solely on quality grounds, but quality considerations informed the weighting given to each study in the narrative synthesis.

### 2.4 Data Synthesis

Quantitative meta-analysis was not feasible owing to the substantial methodological heterogeneity among the included studies: they employ fundamentally different modelling frameworks, define source categories inconsistently, and report results over different time periods and spatial extents. A narrative synthesis approach was therefore adopted. Source contributions were extracted from each study and tabulated by source category. Ranges across studies were calculated, and representative consensus estimates were derived by weighting studies according to their methodological quality, temporal coverage, and relevance to the Delhi airshed.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Study Selection

The database searches yielded 147 unique records after de-duplication. Title and abstract screening excluded 98 records that were clearly outside scope (e.g., studies on gaseous pollutants only, studies in other Indian cities, or review articles without primary data). Full-text assessment was conducted for the remaining 49 records. Of these, 37 were excluded for the following reasons: PM10 only with no separate PM2.5 analysis (n = 14), study area outside Delhi/NCR (n = 9), insufficient methodological detail (n = 7), duplicate reporting of the same dataset (n = 5), and conference abstracts without full data (n = 2). Six studies and institutional reports meeting all inclusion criteria were retained, along with supplementary data from related publications by the same research groups.

### 3.2 Study Characteristics

The six included studies span publication years from 2013 to 2018 and employ a range of methodologies. Their key characteristics are summarised below.

| Study | Year | Method | Sampling Period | Location | Mean PM2.5 (&mu;g/m&sup3;) |
|-------|------|--------|-----------------|----------|---------------------------|
| Guttikunda & Calori | 2013 | Emission inventory + SIM-air dispersion | Annual 2010 | Delhi | ~120 |
| IIT Kanpur (Govt. of Delhi) | 2015 | CMB + dispersion modelling | 2013--2014 | Delhi NCT | ~135 |
| Pant et al. | 2015 | Receptor modelling (CMB) | Winter 2013 | Central Delhi | ~180 (winter) |
| Sharma et al. | 2016 | PMF receptor model | 2013--2014 | South Delhi (IITD) | ~142 |
| TERI-ARAI | 2018 | Emission inventory + AERMOD/CAMx | 2016--2017 | NCR-wide | ~110 (NCR avg.) |
| CEEW synthesis | Various | Multi-study synthesis | Multiple | Delhi/NCR | Variable |

**IIT Kanpur (2015).** Commissioned by the Government of Delhi, this study combined chemical mass balance receptor modelling with atmospheric dispersion simulations. Ambient samples were collected across multiple seasons at several sites in Delhi, and a comprehensive chemical speciation programme supported source identification. The study remains one of the most frequently cited references in Delhi air-quality policy discussions.

**TERI-ARAI (2018).** Conducted by The Energy and Resources Institute in collaboration with the Automotive Research Association of India, this study took an NCR-wide perspective. It developed a detailed emissions inventory for the region and applied both Gaussian (AERMOD) and photochemical (CAMx) dispersion models to estimate source contributions at receptor locations across the NCR.

**Sharma et al. (2016).** This peer-reviewed study applied positive matrix factorisation (PMF) to a year-long dataset of PM2.5 chemical composition collected at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi campus. Seven factors were resolved, representing distinct source types.

**Pant et al. (2015).** Focused on winter-time PM2.5, this study employed receptor modelling at a central Delhi site. Its value lies in the detailed chemical characterisation of winter episodes, when PM2.5 concentrations are at their highest.

**Guttikunda and Calori (2013).** Among the earliest comprehensive assessments, this study built a bottom-up emissions inventory for Delhi and applied the SIM-air suite of dispersion models to estimate ambient concentrations by source sector.

**CEEW synthesis.** The Council on Energy, Environment and Water has published several analyses that synthesise findings from multiple primary studies. While not a single primary study, this body of work provides useful cross-study comparisons and has informed national-level policy discourse.

### 3.3 Source Contributions

The following subsections present findings for each major source category, drawing on the range of estimates across the six included studies.

**Vehicles and transport.** Vehicular emissions -- encompassing exhaust from petrol, diesel, and compressed natural gas vehicles as well as non-exhaust emissions from tyre and brake wear -- are consistently identified as a leading contributor to Delhi's PM2.5. Estimates range from 16% to 39% across the reviewed studies. The IIT Kanpur study attributed approximately 20--25% of winter PM2.5 to vehicular sources, while the TERI-ARAI assessment estimated 17--28% depending on the specific NCR location. Sharma et al. resolved a vehicular factor contributing 19.7% at the IIT Delhi site. The wide range reflects differences in how secondary aerosols formed from vehicular precursors (NOx, VOCs) are allocated: studies that assign secondary contributions back to primary sources report higher vehicular shares. Cold-start emissions and reduced atmospheric dispersion during winter inversions amplify the vehicular contribution during the high-pollution season.

**Biomass and crop-residue burning.** Biomass combustion encompasses both local sources (household cooking and heating with wood, dung, and agricultural residues) and regional crop-stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana, and western Uttar Pradesh. Across the reviewed literature, biomass-related contributions range from 14% to 30%. The contribution is sharply seasonal: during October and November, when post-harvest rice-straw burning peaks, biomass markers (levoglucosan, potassium) dominate the PM2.5 chemical profile, and satellite fire counts correlate strongly with Delhi's pollution episodes. The IIT Kanpur study estimated biomass burning at 17--26%, with the upper end of this range corresponding to the post-monsoon crop-burning season. The TERI-ARAI study estimated a lower contribution of 12--14% for Delhi-specific sources but acknowledged that regional transport of crop-burning emissions could substantially raise this figure at the receptor.

**Industry.** Industrial contributions show the widest inter-study range, from 6% to 35%. This variation is largely attributable to differences in geographical scope. Studies focused narrowly on Delhi NCT, where heavy industry is relatively limited, report lower industrial shares. NCR-wide assessments, such as the TERI-ARAI study (which estimated industry at approximately 24%), capture emissions from the extensive industrial clusters in Faridabad, Ghaziabad, and other satellite cities. The IIT Kanpur study did not isolate industry as a clearly distinct category, instead distributing industrial emissions across several chemical factors. Power plants, brick kilns, and small-scale manufacturing are the primary industrial sub-sources identified.

**Dust (road and construction).** Resuspended road dust and emissions from construction activity contribute an estimated 13--21% of Delhi's PM2.5. Sharma et al. resolved a soil-dust factor at 20.5%, consistent with Delhi's semi-arid climate and extensive construction activity. Dust contributions peak during the pre-monsoon period (March--May), when dry conditions, high winds, and active construction combine to elevate coarse and fine crustal material. Road dust is a year-round contributor, exacerbated by unpaved shoulders, heavy vehicular traffic, and inadequate street-sweeping infrastructure.

**Secondary aerosols.** Secondary inorganic (sulphate, nitrate, ammonium) and organic aerosols formed through atmospheric photochemical reactions of precursor gases (SO2, NOx, NH3, VOCs) account for a substantial fraction of PM2.5 mass. Estimates range from 21% to 30%. Sharma et al. reported a secondary-aerosol factor of 21.3%. These particles are challenging for source apportionment because they cannot be uniquely attributed to a single primary source: sulphate may originate from power-plant SO2, nitrate from vehicular NOx, and ammonium from agricultural ammonia. The difficulty of "re-attributing" secondary mass to primary emitters is a recurrent methodological challenge and a source of inter-study disagreement.

**Waste burning and other sources.** Open burning of municipal solid waste, diesel generator sets, and miscellaneous minor sources together account for an estimated 8--10% of PM2.5. The IIT Kanpur study attributed 8--9% to this category. While modest in percentage terms, waste burning is locally significant in areas adjacent to landfill sites and in neighbourhoods without reliable waste-collection services. Diesel generators, widely used during power outages, contribute both primary PM and precursor gases.

### 3.4 Seasonal Variation

One of the strongest findings across the reviewed literature is the pronounced seasonal dependence of the source mix. During winter (November--February), atmospheric boundary-layer heights contract to 200--400 metres, trapping emissions near the surface and amplifying concentrations from all local sources. Biomass combustion -- both local heating fires and regional crop-stubble burning -- dominates the October--November period, with its contribution declining through December and January as the stubble-burning season ends but residential heating continues. Vehicular contributions are amplified in winter both in absolute terms (higher emissions from cold engines) and in relative terms (reduced dilution).

During the pre-monsoon hot season (March--May), dust resuspension becomes the dominant incremental source. High temperatures, low humidity, and strong convective winds lift crustal material from unpaved surfaces, construction sites, and arid hinterlands. Secondary-aerosol formation also accelerates during this period owing to enhanced photochemistry.

The monsoon season (June--September) brings substantial reductions in PM2.5 across all source categories, as rainfall scavenges particles and wet soils suppress dust. Post-monsoon (October) marks the rapid return of high pollution levels, driven initially by crop burning and then by the onset of winter meteorological conditions.

These seasonal dynamics have important implications: annual-mean source contributions, while useful for aggregate policy, mask the dominant sources during the most hazardous episodes.

### 3.5 Consensus Estimates

Drawing on the ranges reported above and weighting studies by methodological quality, temporal representativeness, and relevance to the Delhi airshed, the following consensus estimates are proposed for policy analysis.

| Source Category | Representative Contribution (%) | Range Across Studies (%) |
|----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Vehicles and transport | 25 | 16--39 |
| Biomass and crop-residue burning | 20 | 14--30 |
| Dust (road and construction) | 18 | 13--21 |
| Industry | 15 | 6--35 |
| Secondary particles | 12 | 21--30 |
| Waste burning and other | 10 | 8--10 |

These estimates should be interpreted with several caveats. First, the secondary-particles category overlaps with primary source categories: a portion of secondary sulphate, nitrate, and organic aerosol originates from vehicular, industrial, and biomass-burning precursors. The representative contribution of 12% shown here reflects the residual secondary fraction not re-allocated to primary sources in most of the reviewed studies; the true secondary formation from all precursors is considerably larger. Second, the consensus percentages represent annual averages for Delhi NCT and may not reflect conditions in specific NCR cities or during specific seasons. Third, these estimates are anchored primarily in data collected between 2010 and 2017; changes in the vehicle fleet, fuel standards, industrial activity, and policy interventions since that period may have shifted the source mix.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Methodological Heterogeneity

The most significant challenge in synthesising Delhi's source apportionment literature is the diversity of methods employed. Receptor models (CMB and PMF) work backward from measured ambient chemical composition to infer source contributions, whereas dispersion models work forward from emission inventories through atmospheric transport to predict concentrations at receptor sites. Each approach carries distinct assumptions and limitations. CMB requires a priori knowledge of source profiles, which may not accurately represent Delhi's specific emission mix. PMF is data-driven and does not require source profiles, but the interpretation of resolved factors involves subjective judgement. Dispersion models depend heavily on the accuracy and completeness of the underlying emission inventory, which for Delhi remains uncertain, particularly for diffuse sources such as waste burning and residential biomass combustion.

These methodological differences mean that no single study should be treated as providing the definitive answer. Rather, confidence is greatest where multiple independent methods converge on similar estimates -- as they broadly do for vehicular emissions and dust -- and lowest where methods diverge substantially, as for the industrial category.

### 4.2 Transboundary Contributions

A substantial fraction of Delhi's PM2.5 originates from sources outside the city boundaries. Back-trajectory analyses and satellite-based fire detection consistently demonstrate that emissions from crop-stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana are transported hundreds of kilometres to Delhi during October and November. Industrial emissions from NCR satellite cities, thermal power plants in neighbouring states, and long-range transport of dust from the Thar Desert and west Asia further complicate the picture. Estimates of the non-local contribution range from 25% to as high as 50% during specific episodes.

This transboundary dimension has profound implications for governance. Delhi's municipal and state authorities can directly regulate only sources within their jurisdiction. Addressing crop burning in Punjab or industrial emissions in Uttar Pradesh requires coordination across state boundaries -- a persistent challenge in India's federal system that the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas, established in 2020, was designed to address.

### 4.3 Temporal Dynamics

The dramatic seasonal variation in both total PM2.5 levels and the source mix argues strongly for seasonally differentiated policy responses. An annual-average source apportionment, while useful for long-term planning, fails to identify the dominant contributors during Delhi's most hazardous air-quality episodes. For example, aggressive anti-stubble-burning measures are most impactful in October and November, road-dust suppression measures yield the greatest benefits in March through May, and vehicular-emission controls deliver year-round dividends but are especially important during winter inversions. Policy frameworks that recognise and respond to these temporal dynamics -- such as the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) -- are better aligned with the underlying science than static annual regulations.

### 4.4 Limitations

Several limitations of the reviewed evidence base warrant acknowledgement. First, most of the included studies rely on data collected before 2018; the source mix may have evolved since then in response to policy interventions (e.g., the shift to BS-VI fuel standards, the ban on pet coke in NCR industries, and expansions of the Delhi Metro). Second, the geographical definition of the study area varies across studies -- some focus on Delhi NCT while others encompass the broader NCR -- making direct comparison of percentage contributions problematic. Third, sampling-site representativeness varies: a single monitoring site in south Delhi may not capture the pollution experience of residents in north-west Delhi or in dense commercial areas. Fourth, source categories are not fully independent: vehicular NOx contributes to secondary nitrate formation, and biomass-burning VOCs contribute to secondary organic aerosol. The allocation of secondary aerosol mass back to primary sources remains an unresolved methodological challenge that introduces systematic uncertainty into all estimates. Finally, the quality-assessment framework used in this review, while drawing on established principles, has not itself been validated for environmental source apportionment studies.

### 4.5 Research Gaps

Several priority areas for future research emerge from this review. First, there is an urgent need for updated source apportionment studies using data collected after 2020 to reflect changes in the emissions landscape. Second, the application of consistent methodology across multiple sites and seasons within a single study design would substantially improve comparability. Third, real-time source apportionment using online mass spectrometry (e.g., aerosol chemical speciation monitors coupled with PMF) offers the potential for continuous, high-resolution source tracking but has seen limited deployment in Delhi to date. Fourth, improved quantification of transboundary contributions -- through coordinated multi-site campaigns, chemical-transport modelling, and satellite-constrained source attribution -- is essential for informing regional governance. Fifth, health-oriented source apportionment that links specific source categories to specific health outcomes (e.g., through oxidative-potential analysis) would enable more health-protective prioritisation of interventions.

## 5. Conclusions and Policy Implications

This systematic review finds that vehicular emissions and biomass burning are consistently identified as the two largest contributors to Delhi's PM2.5 across the reviewed literature, together accounting for an estimated 40--50% of annual-mean fine-particle mass. Dust, industry, secondary aerosol formation, and waste burning collectively account for the remainder. The source mix varies substantially by season, with biomass burning dominating the post-monsoon period and dust peaking in the pre-monsoon hot season.

These findings point toward several policy priorities. First, sustained and intensified action on vehicular emissions -- including accelerated fleet electrification, enforcement of emission standards, congestion management, and expansion of public transport -- is warranted given the year-round significance of this source. Second, regional coordination to address crop-residue burning remains essential; Delhi cannot solve its worst pollution episodes through local action alone. Third, dust-control measures (road paving, construction-site management, mechanised sweeping) offer cost-effective gains, particularly during the dry season. Fourth, industrial regulation across the NCR -- not just within Delhi's borders -- is needed to address the full scope of industrial contributions. Fifth, policies should be seasonally differentiated, deploying the most stringent measures during the meteorological conditions that trap pollution most effectively.

Finally, this review underscores the need for ongoing investment in monitoring, chemical speciation, and source apportionment research. The evidence base, while informative, is dated and methodologically fragmented. A nationally coordinated, regularly updated source apportionment programme would provide the scientific foundation for adaptive, evidence-based air-quality management in Delhi and other Indian cities facing similar challenges.
