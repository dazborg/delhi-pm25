# Health Effects of PM2.5 Exposure: A Systematic Review

## Abstract

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the single largest environmental risk factor for premature mortality worldwide. This systematic review synthesises the epidemiological literature on the health effects of long-term PM2.5 exposure, with the specific objective of selecting concentration-response functions (CRFs) suitable for health impact assessment in Delhi, India. We reviewed meta-analyses, large cohort studies, and WHO-endorsed estimates published between 2010 and 2024. The selected CRFs yield relative risk estimates of 1.095 (95% CI: 1.066--1.126) for all-cause mortality, 1.10 (95% CI: 1.05--1.15) for cardiovascular mortality, 1.31 (95% CI: 1.15--1.49) for respiratory mortality, and 1.12 (95% CI: 1.03--1.21) for lung cancer, each per 10 ug/m3 increment in annual mean PM2.5. We discuss the competing Integrated Exposure-Response and Global Exposure Mortality Model frameworks, the challenges of extrapolating CRFs derived in high-income settings to Delhi's extreme pollution levels, and the shape of the dose-response curve at high concentrations. These CRFs underpin the quantitative health burden estimates presented elsewhere on this site.

## 1. Introduction

Ambient air pollution is now recognised as the leading environmental cause of disease and premature death globally. Within the complex mixture of pollutants that comprise urban air, fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less (PM2.5) has been most consistently associated with adverse health outcomes. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 attributed approximately 4.14 million deaths and 103.1 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to ambient PM2.5 exposure worldwide, making it the fifth-leading risk factor for mortality globally.

The biological mechanisms through which PM2.5 damages human health are now well characterised. Owing to their small size, these particles penetrate deep into the alveolar region of the lungs and can translocate into the systemic circulation. This triggers a cascade of pathophysiological responses. **Oxidative stress** arises when reactive oxygen species generated by particle surfaces and transition metals overwhelm cellular antioxidant defences. This drives **local and systemic inflammation**, characterised by elevated C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and fibrinogen levels. Downstream consequences include endothelial dysfunction, accelerated atherosclerosis, autonomic nervous system imbalance, pro-thrombotic states, and epigenetic modifications. In the lungs, chronic exposure promotes airway remodelling, impaired mucociliary clearance, and increased susceptibility to infection. These mechanisms collectively explain why PM2.5 exposure is associated with such a broad spectrum of disease endpoints, from ischaemic heart disease and stroke to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections, and lung cancer.

Delhi presents a particularly urgent case for health impact assessment. With an annual mean PM2.5 concentration of approximately 104.7 ug/m3 (as estimated in our analysis), the city exceeds the WHO annual guideline of 5 ug/m3 by a factor of roughly twenty. During the winter months of November through January, daily concentrations routinely exceed 200 ug/m3 and episodically surpass 400 ug/m3. A population of over 30 million people is therefore exposed to PM2.5 levels that are among the highest recorded in any major city worldwide. Quantifying the resulting health burden requires carefully selected concentration-response functions grounded in the best available epidemiological evidence, and an honest assessment of the uncertainties involved in extrapolating that evidence to Delhi's extreme exposure context.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Search Strategy

We conducted a structured literature search across PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Scopus using the following search string: ("PM2.5" OR "fine particulate matter") AND ("mortality" OR "health effects" OR "morbidity" OR "concentration-response") AND ("cohort" OR "meta-analysis" OR "systematic review"). The search was restricted to studies published between January 2010 and December 2024, and to English-language publications. We supplemented this with manual searches of reference lists from key reviews, including the WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines (2021), the Global Burden of Disease Study methodology papers, and the Health Effects Institute's State of Global Air reports. Priority was given to meta-analyses that pooled multiple cohort studies and to individual cohort studies with sample sizes exceeding 100,000 participants.

### 2.2 Inclusion Criteria

Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) meta-analyses, systematic reviews, or large prospective cohort studies examining the association between long-term (annual or multi-year average) ambient PM2.5 exposure and mortality or major morbidity endpoints; (2) provision of quantitative relative risk or hazard ratio estimates with confidence intervals, expressed per defined increment in PM2.5 concentration; and (3) adequate adjustment for major confounders including age, sex, smoking status, and socioeconomic factors. We excluded studies focused exclusively on short-term (daily or weekly) exposure, studies of indoor air pollution without ambient exposure characterisation, and ecological studies lacking individual-level follow-up.

### 2.3 CRF Selection Framework

The selection of concentration-response functions for our health impact model followed a hierarchical approach. We prioritised, in order: (1) CRFs endorsed by the WHO in its most recent systematic reviews and guidelines; (2) pooled estimates from the most comprehensive and methodologically rigorous meta-analyses; (3) estimates from the largest individual cohort studies, particularly those conducted in or including low- and middle-income country populations. Where multiple credible estimates existed for the same endpoint, we selected the value most consistent with the overall weight of evidence, favouring estimates from reviews that included the broadest geographic and demographic coverage. All selected CRFs assume a log-linear relationship between PM2.5 concentration and the natural logarithm of relative risk, which is the standard functional form adopted by WHO for health impact assessment.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 All-Cause Mortality

**Selected CRF: RR = 1.095 per 10 ug/m3 (95% CI: 1.066--1.126)**

The association between long-term PM2.5 exposure and all-cause mortality is the most extensively studied endpoint in air pollution epidemiology. The foundational evidence comes from the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II (ACS CPS-II), which followed approximately 500,000 adults across U.S. metropolitan areas and established the first robust link between fine particulate matter and premature death. The Harvard Six Cities Study, with its smaller but more precisely characterised exposure assessment, provided early corroboration.

The evidence base has since expanded considerably. Chen and Hoek (2020) conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of 53 cohort studies encompassing populations from North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. Their pooled hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.08 (95% CI: 1.06--1.09) per 10 ug/m3, though they noted substantial heterogeneity across studies (I-squared = 75.1%). Studies from North America and Europe yielded broadly consistent estimates in the range of 1.04 to 1.14 per 10 ug/m3.

The WHO systematic review update, prepared in support of the 2021 Global Air Quality Guidelines and further refined in 2024, pooled over 20 cohort studies with improved exposure assessment methods. The resulting central estimate of 1.095 per 10 ug/m3 reflects the inclusion of more recent cohorts with satellite-derived exposure estimates that provide better spatial resolution, as well as the incorporation of studies from lower-pollution settings that strengthen the evidence for effects below previous guideline levels. We adopt this as our primary CRF for all-cause mortality because it represents the most current synthesis of the global evidence endorsed by the WHO.

It is worth noting that the Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC), with 2.5 million subjects, and the Medicare cohort studies in the United States, with over 60 million person-years of follow-up, both reported statistically significant associations at concentrations well below previous guideline levels, supporting the absence of a clear no-effect threshold.

### 3.2 Cardiovascular Mortality

**Selected CRF: RR = 1.10 per 10 ug/m3 (95% CI: 1.05--1.15)**

Cardiovascular disease is the single largest contributor to PM2.5-attributable mortality, accounting for an estimated 50--60% of all air-pollution-related deaths in most populations. The mechanistic basis is well established: chronic PM2.5 exposure promotes systemic inflammation (evidenced by elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and interleukin-6), endothelial dysfunction (reduced flow-mediated dilation), autonomic imbalance (reduced heart rate variability), and accelerated atherosclerosis (increased carotid intima-media thickness in exposed populations). These pathways converge to increase the risk of ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and heart failure.

Meta-analytic estimates for cardiovascular mortality have been remarkably consistent. Cesaroni et al. (2014), pooling 22 European cohorts in the ESCAPE project, reported a hazard ratio of 1.12 (95% CI: 1.02--1.24) per 5 ug/m3. Rescaled to a 10 ug/m3 increment, this yields approximately 1.25, though the European cohorts had relatively low mean exposures. The broader meta-analysis by Chen and Hoek (2020) found a pooled estimate of 1.11 (95% CI: 1.09--1.14) per 10 ug/m3 when restricted to cardiovascular endpoints. The WHO-endorsed estimate of 1.10 per 10 ug/m3 reflects a conservative central value within this range, and we adopt it for our model.

### 3.3 Respiratory Mortality

**Selected CRF: RR = 1.31 per 10 ug/m3 (95% CI: 1.15--1.49)**

The relative risk for respiratory mortality is substantially higher per unit exposure than that for cardiovascular mortality, though respiratory deaths constitute a smaller fraction of total deaths in most populations. This CRF encompasses deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, and lower respiratory infections.

The higher RR estimate reflects the direct exposure pathway: inhaled particles deposit on the airway epithelium and alveolar surfaces, causing sustained local inflammation, oxidative damage, impaired mucociliary clearance, and increased susceptibility to respiratory pathogens. Chronic exposure accelerates the decline in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and promotes airway remodelling characteristic of COPD.

A 2023 meta-analysis focusing on low- and middle-income countries, where exposure levels and population characteristics more closely resemble those in Delhi, found point estimates for respiratory mortality that were at the upper end of or above the confidence interval from high-income country studies. This may reflect higher baseline susceptibility due to co-exposures (biomass fuel use, occupational dusts, tuberculosis burden) or differences in exposure composition, though residual confounding cannot be excluded.

### 3.4 Lung Cancer

**Selected CRF: RR = 1.12 per 10 ug/m3 (95% CI: 1.03--1.21)**

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified outdoor air pollution and, specifically, particulate matter as Group 1 carcinogens in 2013, based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. The meta-analysis by Hamra et al. (2014), which pooled 18 studies with careful adjustment for smoking, found a summary relative risk of 1.09 (95% CI: 1.04--1.14) per 10 ug/m3. More recent analyses, incorporating additional cohorts and improved exposure assessment, have produced slightly higher point estimates.

The selected CRF of 1.12 per 10 ug/m3 reflects the updated evidence synthesis. Mechanistically, PM2.5 promotes carcinogenesis through DNA damage from reactive oxygen species, epigenetic alterations (particularly DNA methylation changes), chronic inflammation that creates a tumour-promoting microenvironment, and direct mutagenic activity of adsorbed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. It should be noted that the lung cancer CRF may have a longer latency than cardiovascular effects, meaning that current exposure levels in Delhi may not produce their full carcinogenic impact for one to two decades.

### 3.5 Life Expectancy Impact

A complementary approach to health impact assessment is the estimation of life expectancy loss attributable to PM2.5 exposure. The Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), developed by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, provides a widely cited framework for this calculation.

The AQLI methodology is grounded in the quasi-experimental study by Ebenstein et al. (2017), which exploited China's Huai River heating policy as a natural experiment. North of the Huai River, the Chinese government provided free coal for winter heating, resulting in substantially higher PM2.5 concentrations than in otherwise similar areas to the south. By comparing life expectancies across this discontinuity and controlling for confounders, the study estimated that each additional 10 ug/m3 of sustained PM2.5 exposure reduced life expectancy by approximately 0.98 years, or equivalently, each 1 ug/m3 reduces life expectancy by approximately 0.098 years.

Applying this coefficient to Delhi's mean PM2.5 concentration of approximately 104.7 ug/m3 above the WHO guideline of 5 ug/m3 (i.e., an excess of roughly 99.7 ug/m3) yields an estimated life expectancy reduction of approximately 9.8 years for a Delhi resident compared to a counterfactual of clean air. The AQLI 2025 report estimates a somewhat lower figure of approximately 8.2 years for Delhi, reflecting differences in the exact concentration estimates and methodological refinements. Either figure represents a staggering burden, comparable in magnitude to the life expectancy impact of lifelong smoking.

### 3.6 The GEMM vs IER Debate

A critical methodological question for health impact assessment in high-pollution settings like Delhi is the shape of the concentration-response function at high exposure levels. Two competing modelling frameworks have produced markedly different estimates of the global burden of disease from PM2.5.

**The Integrated Exposure-Response (IER) model**, developed by Burnett et al. (2014) and adopted by the Global Burden of Disease Study, draws on evidence from four sources of combustion-related fine particulate exposure: ambient air pollution, household air pollution from solid fuel use, secondhand tobacco smoke, and active smoking. By integrating these diverse exposure ranges, the IER covers a wide concentration spectrum from approximately 5 ug/m3 to over 30,000 ug/m3 (the cigarette-smoking equivalent). A key feature of the IER is that it exhibits a pronounced flattening of the concentration-response curve at high ambient concentrations. This supralinear shape means that the marginal health impact of each additional ug/m3 diminishes at high concentrations. Using the IER, the GBD 2015 estimated approximately 4.2 million global deaths attributable to ambient PM2.5.

**The Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM)**, introduced by Burnett et al. (2018), takes a fundamentally different approach. It uses only data from ambient air pollution cohort studies, arguing that the toxicological profiles of ambient PM2.5, cigarette smoke, and household biomass combustion are sufficiently different to warrant separate modelling. The GEMM pooled 41 cohort studies across 16 countries, including several from China with relatively high exposure levels. The resulting concentration-response curve is more nearly log-linear, without the pronounced flattening seen in the IER. Using the GEMM, Burnett et al. estimated approximately 8.9 million global deaths attributable to ambient PM2.5, more than double the IER-based estimate.

This divergence is critically important for Delhi. At Delhi's annual mean of approximately 104.7 ug/m3, the IER predicts a substantially attenuated response compared to simple log-linear extrapolation, while the GEMM predicts a larger effect that is closer to the log-linear projection. The log-linear CRFs we employ in our model (derived from the WHO meta-analyses) will produce estimates that fall between these two frameworks but generally closer to the GEMM than the IER. We regard this as a reasonable central estimate but acknowledge the substantial structural uncertainty.

### 3.7 DALYs and QALYs

To express health impacts in a metric that captures both premature mortality and the morbidity burden of non-fatal disease, we employ the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) framework developed by the WHO and used in the Global Burden of Disease studies. One DALY represents the loss of one year of full health. It is composed of two components: years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD), such that DALYs = YLL + YLD.

The GBD 2019 estimated that ambient PM2.5 exposure was responsible for 103.1 million DALYs globally. Of these, the majority (approximately 95%) were attributable to premature mortality (YLL), with the remainder reflecting the morbidity burden from conditions such as COPD, ischaemic heart disease, and lower respiratory infections in survivors.

For our model, we approximate the DALY burden as follows. Each attributable death is assigned an average of 12 years of life lost, based on the age distribution of PM2.5-attributable mortality in India (which skews somewhat younger than in high-income countries due to India's demographic structure). We then incorporate a YLD fraction of approximately 5% of the total DALY burden, reflecting the morbidity component. The resulting formula is: DALYs = attributable deaths x 12 / (1 - 0.05). Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) losses can be approximated as broadly comparable to DALYs for the purpose of economic valuation, though the two metrics are not precisely interchangeable.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Applicability to Delhi

The most significant limitation of the CRFs selected for this analysis is that the majority of the underlying evidence comes from cohort studies conducted in high-income countries, where annual mean PM2.5 concentrations typically range from 5 to 35 ug/m3. Extrapolating these relationships to Delhi, where concentrations range from approximately 42 ug/m3 in the cleanest monsoon months to over 240 ug/m3 during the worst winter episodes, involves substantial uncertainty.

Several considerations partially mitigate this concern. First, a growing body of evidence from China and India suggests that the CRFs derived in Western cohorts are broadly applicable to Asian populations. The China National Hypertension Survey Epidemiology Follow-up Study, the China-PAR project, and analyses of the Million Death Study in India have all produced RR estimates that are consistent with or somewhat higher than those from Western meta-analyses. Second, the GEMM explicitly included Chinese cohorts with mean exposures above 50 ug/m3, providing some direct evidence at exposure levels that overlap with Delhi's lower range. Third, toxicological studies provide mechanistic plausibility for health effects across a wide concentration range without an obvious saturation point, at least for inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways.

Nevertheless, the extrapolation to Delhi's peak winter concentrations (above 200 ug/m3) goes well beyond the observed range of any ambient air pollution cohort study, and the resulting estimates should be interpreted with appropriate caution.

### 4.2 Shape of the Concentration-Response Curve

The functional form of the concentration-response relationship at high exposures remains one of the most consequential unresolved questions in air pollution epidemiology. At low concentrations (below approximately 30 ug/m3), recent evidence from large North American and European cohorts strongly supports a supralinear relationship, meaning that the marginal effect per ug/m3 is steeper at lower concentrations. This finding, which motivated the WHO's decision to lower its annual guideline to 5 ug/m3 in 2021, implies that even modest pollution reductions in relatively clean cities yield substantial health benefits.

At high concentrations, the evidence is less clear. The IER model assumes pronounced flattening, drawing on the cigarette-smoking literature to argue that biological defence mechanisms partially attenuate the response at very high exposures. The GEMM, in contrast, finds a more linear relationship even above 50 ug/m3, though data are sparse at concentrations above 80 ug/m3. The log-linear model we employ assumes no flattening whatsoever, and this likely results in some overestimation of health effects during Delhi's November and December peak pollution episodes, when concentrations regularly exceed 200 ug/m3. We consider this a conservative (i.e., health-protective) modelling choice, but users should be aware that the true concentration-response relationship at these extreme levels remains uncertain.

### 4.3 Vulnerable Populations

The CRFs used in this analysis represent population-average estimates and do not capture the heterogeneity of susceptibility across demographic groups. Considerable evidence indicates that certain populations in Delhi face disproportionately elevated risks.

**Children** are particularly vulnerable due to their higher minute ventilation per unit body weight, immature immune systems, and developing lungs. Exposure during early life has been associated with impaired lung growth, increased incidence of asthma, and effects on neurodevelopment. **The elderly**, particularly those with pre-existing cardiovascular or respiratory disease, have reduced physiological reserve to cope with the additional inflammatory burden imposed by PM2.5. **Outdoor workers**, including street vendors, rickshaw drivers, construction labourers, and traffic police, experience substantially higher personal exposures than the ambient monitoring data would suggest, as they spend prolonged periods in microenvironments with elevated concentrations. Socioeconomic factors further compound vulnerability, as lower-income populations in Delhi are more likely to live near pollution sources, less likely to have access to air purification, and more likely to have co-morbidities that amplify PM2.5-related risks.

### 4.4 Model Limitations

Several additional limitations of our health impact model warrant explicit acknowledgement:

- **Log-linear extrapolation**: As discussed, the assumption of a log-linear CRF likely overestimates health impacts at the extreme concentrations observed during Delhi's winter pollution episodes. Alternative functional forms (GEMM, IER) would produce different estimates, particularly at concentrations above 150 ug/m3.

- **Counterfactual concentration**: We use 5 ug/m3 (the WHO annual guideline) as the counterfactual, or theoretical minimum risk, concentration. While evidence supports health effects down to this level and possibly below, no large urban population has achieved such levels, and the practical achievability for Delhi within any reasonable timeframe is questionable. This counterfactual maximises the estimated attributable burden.

- **Baseline mortality rates**: Our model uses national Indian age-specific mortality rates. Delhi's actual mortality rates may differ due to the city's younger demographic profile, urban healthcare access advantages, and other factors. Delhi-specific life tables would improve the accuracy of the estimates.

- **Co-pollutant confounding**: PM2.5 is correlated with other pollutants including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and sulphur dioxide (SO2), which have independent health effects. Most of the cohort studies underlying our CRFs used single-pollutant models, and the CRFs may therefore partially capture the effects of correlated co-pollutants. Multi-pollutant models generally produce somewhat attenuated PM2.5 effect estimates, suggesting some degree of overestimation in single-pollutant CRFs.

- **Chronic versus acute effects**: Our model applies annual CRFs to annual average concentrations and does not separately model the acute effects of short-term pollution spikes. The acute mortality effects of daily PM2.5 variation are well documented but are partially (though not entirely) captured within the long-term CRFs we employ.

---

## 5. Conclusions

The epidemiological evidence linking long-term PM2.5 exposure to premature mortality is robust, consistent, and supported by well-characterised biological mechanisms. At Delhi's current pollution levels, the health burden implied by even the most conservative CRFs is substantial. Our selected concentration-response functions, drawn from WHO-endorsed meta-analyses and representing the current scientific consensus, indicate relative risks of 1.095 for all-cause mortality, 1.10 for cardiovascular mortality, 1.31 for respiratory mortality, and 1.12 for lung cancer, each per 10 ug/m3 increment above the counterfactual.

When applied to Delhi's annual mean PM2.5 of approximately 104.7 ug/m3, these CRFs imply that a large fraction of the city's mortality burden is attributable to air pollution. The AQLI estimate of 8.2 years of lost life expectancy for the average Delhi resident, derived from an independent quasi-experimental methodology, corroborates the order of magnitude of harm suggested by the CRF-based approach.

These estimates should be interpreted as indicative of the scale of the health crisis rather than as precise point predictions. The documented uncertainties, particularly regarding the shape of the dose-response curve at extreme concentrations, the applicability of high-income country CRFs to Delhi's population, and co-pollutant confounding, all introduce margin of error in both directions. Nevertheless, the central conclusion is unambiguous: PM2.5 exposure at the levels experienced by Delhi's population causes profound and quantifiable harm to human health, and aggressive pollution reduction would yield correspondingly large health benefits.
